# Basic Decisions
## jsdoc

* the /docs/ folder is created, but the contents are ignored
* To start jsdoc there is a bash-script `./jsdoc.sh`

## lint

* class, methods and functions now need jsdocs (`eslintrc.js`)

## jest

* unit tests shall be placed in `tests/unit/`
* example `tests/unit/example.spec.js`

# TODOs and MAYBEs
## Vue Components

* Most Vue components should have a corresponding unit test
